      "Chs": "第三天 - \n我发现了一个小的天然洞穴群落，并决定休息一下。在这些行星上发现的岩石异常坚硬，而且它具有吸收光的奇怪特性。即使我的手电筒直接照在这块石头上，我也看不到周围的任何东西，因为石头似乎在吞噬我手电筒发出的光。我在这里点燃了一堆篝火，我感觉到一阵微风从裂缝中吹过，希望我不会被烟呛到。我可以看到下面有更多的洞穴，我很快就会去探索。",
      "Eng": "Day 3 - \nI found a small natural cave system, and decided to take a rest. The rock found on these planets is unusually hard, and it has this weird property that absorbs light. Even shining my flashlight directly at this rock, I can't see very much of anything around me as the rock appears to eat the light coming out of my flashlight. I lit a campfire in here, after I felt a breeze slipping through the cracks, hopefully I don't choke myself with the smoke. I can see more caves below, I'll explore those in a minute."
