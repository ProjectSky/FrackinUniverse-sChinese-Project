      "Chs": "第五天 - /n呕。这简直太恶心了。 在试图远离透明金属的海洋的同时，我发现自己正处于另一个洞穴系统中，其中的地板并没有像之前的岩石一样奇异地吸收我的光。 我可能应该更加小心，但是刚往这物质上迈上一步，我就发现自己从一个陡坡上滑下来，当我着地时，我在房间里反复蹦了几次，然后以我见过的最恶心的焦油状物质把我脸裹起来的结果告终！！ 我决定设法爬出垃圾并回到占多数的岩石上面。",
      "Eng": "Day 5 - Yuck. While trying to get away from the sea of transparent metal, I found myself in another cave system, the floor of which oddly did not absorb my light like the rock had before. I probably should have been more careful, but one step on this stuff, and I found myself sliding down a steep incline, and when I landed, I bounced around the room several times and wound up face-first in some of the most disgusting tar-like substance I've ever seen! I managed to somehow crawl out of the junk and back up onto more rock."
