      "Chs": "人们对所谓的“阿托罗斯”世界知之甚少。根据atrophy(萎缩)来命名它十分恰当，因为这些天体内在的古怪在银河系的所有已知物种中都引起了恐惧的低语。许多理论认为这些肉质的世界是具有智慧的。这很荒谬，但人们总是迷信于此。尽管如此，有一件事是肯定的：这些地方令人十分不安。",
      "Eng": "Little is known of what have been dubbed 'Atropus' worlds. The reference to atrophy is apt, for the innane strangeness of these celestial bodies cause murmurs of fear in every known species inhabiting the galaxy. Many theorize these fleshy worlds are sapient. Preposterous, but people will always be superstitious. Still, one must give credit where it is due: These places are unsettling."

      "Eng": "The stench can only be tolerated for so long. Eventually the rankness permeates even the most adequate protections. At that point it becomes almost impossible to keep a mask on. Involuntarily, you will eventually try to pry it off, despite knowing the air makes you crazy. The team has dubbed it 'the meat fever' and it is liable to be the death of us if care is not taken."
