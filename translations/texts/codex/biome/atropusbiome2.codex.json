      "Eng": "I was not prepared for the bizarre place. Simply breathing the air caused immediate loss of mental acuity, and mild hallucinations began mere seconds after exposure. As time progressed the symptoms increased in severity. Within 30 seconds I was substantially less capable of cohesive thought and at one point attempted to ingest my own finger."
