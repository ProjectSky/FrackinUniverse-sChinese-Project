      "Chs": "第一天 - /n我在我的系统扫描仪上看到了一个奇怪的星球，并决定去探索它。我的SAIL不知道该怎么去做，通过对行星的扫描发现，由于大气层的组成，它永远处于半黑暗中，而且它着巨量的矿石：钛、钍、铯，甚至还有一些以前从未发现过的矿物。如果我能弄到这些矿物的话，我打赌我一定会发财的！大气扫描显示，除了阻止光线通过的奇怪气体外，地面的空气实际上是可呼吸的，温度也很适宜。",
      "Eng": "Day 1 - /nI saw a weird planet on my system scanners and decided to explore it. My SAIL did not know what to make of it, and scanning the planet revealed it to be perpetually in semi-darkness due to the composition of its atmosphere, and also that it had a plethora of ore: Titanium, Thorium, Neptunium, and even some minerals that have never been discovered before. If I could get my hands on some of this stuff, I bet I'd be rich! Atmosphere scans show that other than the strange gasses that prevent light from getting through, the air at ground level is actually breathable and of favorable temperature."
