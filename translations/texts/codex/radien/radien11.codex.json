      "Chs": "最近，我们发现了一个巨大的全息图，描绘的是超过一个星球大小的犬科动物，藏在艾肯鬼城的一个遗迹中。它几乎无法运作，但古代技术的弹性足以承受它最后一次使用后的几个世纪。激活后，巨大的全息图出现了，动画化地描绘了这个犬类生物在一系列八个世界上的祝福动作。光线离开它的身体，注入这八个世界中的每一个，此后大约每60秒重复一次这个动作，直到我们停止运行这个装置。\n我们推测，这是他们在某个时期可能崇拜的神之一。如果我们的艾肯朋友提供的文件准确的话，它的名字从符文中翻译过来似乎是^orange;“ORANA”^reset;。仅凭这一点，我们也是巧妇难为无米之炊，只能假设它至少是可用的。 \n这个装置本身是在一个几乎完好无损的艾肯城市（如果你能把这个地方称为城市的话...因为我也不知道如何称呼）中被发现的，它由石墨和钴的奇怪环形图案组成，形成无数的结构，像摩天大楼一样耸立在上面，但是又由八边形的“单元”组成，很可能是独立的公寓。曾几何时，本来可以作为窗户的东西现在变成了没有任何装饰的空洞，使我们能够毫无问题地看到这些奇怪的隔间的内部。\n几乎所有的建筑都覆盖着一层薄薄的灰烬状物质，使一切看起来都像是在古代的一场大火中被焚烧过。然而，我们采集的样品很快就打消了这种想法。是的，我们发现的是一层薄薄的艾肯人遗骸，经过几千年的分解，只剩下了细小的灰尘。 \n当你想到这些时，你会感到很难过：集体的成就、记忆、知识、希望和梦想、孩子、兄弟姐妹、母亲和父亲、梦想和愿望...全部化为了灰尘。\n\n我们探索了这座城市的大部分，它总共覆盖了30多公里的领土。由于大多奥肯人的创造物都是艾肯球茎制造的，并且早已腐烂，所以几乎没有发现可以使用或识别的东西。与以前所有寻找古代艾肯传说或技术的行动一样，这次旅行几乎完全失败。直到最后一天。\n\n你看，我们偶然发现了一个似乎是竞技场或体育场的地方（就其形状而言）。我们本来准备假设它只是体育设施，直到一股奇异的气味袭来。我们感到不得不去调查。里面躺着一大片“废品”，其中大部分早已腐烂了。尽管如此，有几件东西还是完好无损。一个是由绿色石头组成的雕像，大约有两个人那么大。这座雕像雕刻出一个不定形的水生生物，可怕地蹲在一个类似基座的地方。装饰这座雕像的是我以前没有见过的密集的文字。也许是艾肯族的古老语言？也许这个雕像是他们的神灵之一！\n第二个完好的物体是一个类似电脑的小装置，比三度仪小。虽然没有功能，但很显然是艾肯的设计（熟悉的葡萄状风格很明显）。它利用内部零件进行计算，与宇宙社会使用的任何东西都没有相似之处。进一步的研究表明，它是一种基于蛋白质的计算机。这是重大发现......直到它在我们离开轨道的那一刻开始衰变。\n最后一个值得注意的物物件是一具艾肯的遗体。它躺在垃圾堆上，显然是在那里被杀死的，尽管它已经死亡，但却异常的完整。一根巨大的长矛穿透过躯体（长度：3米），将它固定在垃圾堆中。然而，这具遗体并没有重归为他们那种典型的石墨状石头。它仍然保持着柔韧，就像刚被杀死一样。测算结果表明，这个艾肯已经死了20多万年。经过检查长矛，我们得到了不寻常的结果：它是由一种奇怪的绿色金属制成的，我们都无法识别。也许不管这种材料是什么，这玩意能防止艾肯的腐烂？",
      "Eng": "Recently, we discovered a massive hologram depicting canid-looking beast well over the size of a planet, tucked in the remains of one of the X'i ghost towns. It barely functioned, but the Ancient tech was resilient enough to withstand the eons since it was last used. When activated, the giant hologram appeared, animating and depicting this canine creature making a blessing motion over a series of eight worlds. Light left its body to infuse each of these eight worlds, and this action repeated approximately every 60 seconds thereafter until we deactivated the device.\nWe speculate that this is one of the gods they may have worshipped at one point in time. The translation of its name from runes appears to be ^orange;'ORANA'^reset;, if the paper from our X'ian friend is accurate. With only this to work with we have little other choice than to assume it is, at the very least, usable.\nThe device itself was found while scavenging through a nearly intact X'ian city (if you can call this place a city...I am not sure how best to name it) composed of strange looping patterns of graphite and cobalt merged together to form myriad structures that towered above like skyscrapers but composed of octogonal 'units' that could very well have been individual apartments. What would have passed for windows at some point were now empty portholes devoid of decoration, allowing us to see inside of these strange compartments without much issue.\nCovering nearly all of the structures was a thin layer of an ash-like substance that gave everything the appearance of having been burned in a great conflagration in the ancient past. Samples we took soon dispelled that idea, however. No, instead what we had discovered was a thin film of X'ian remains broken down over millenia into nothing but a fine dust.\nIt's sad when you think about it : The collective accomplishments, memories, knowledge, hopes and dreams, children, brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, dreams and aspirations...now nothing but dust.\nWe explored much of this city, which in total covered more than 30km of territory. Very little was found that could be used or identified due to the fact that the majority of X'ian creations are made *of* X'ians and had long since decayed. As with all previous forays to locate ancient X'ian lore or technology, this trip met with near total failure. Until the last day.\n\nYou see, we had stumbled onto what appeared to be an arena or stadium (insofar as its shape was concerned). We had prepared to assume it was nothing but a sporting facility until a curious odor struck us. We felt compelled to investigate. Within, a vast field of 'junk' lay, most of it long since decayed. Despite this, a few pieces were intact. One, a statue composed of greenish stone, about the size of a two men. This statue featured a figure of amorphous aquatic nature squatting horribly on a pedestal of sorts. Adorning this statue was a dense script of characters I had not previously seen. Perhaps the ancient language of the X'i? Maybe this figure was one of their deities!\nThe second intact object was a small computer-like device smaller than a Tricorder. While non-functioning, was clearly of X'i design (the familiar vine-like style was apparent). It utilized internal parts for computing that bear no resemblance to anything used in the galactic community. Further study revealed it to be a Protein-based computer. This was a momentous discovery...until it began to decay the second we left orbit.\nThe final object of note was the remains of a single X'i. Resting atop the pile, and clearly killed there, it was unusually intact despite being deceased. Through its torso protruded an enormous spear (length: 3 meters) that anchored it into the refuse pile. It had not reverted to the graphite-like stone typical of their kind, however. It remained pliable as if recently killed. Dating indicated that the figure was more than 200,000 years dead. Upon inspection, the spear returned unusual results: it was made of a strange greenish metal none of us were able to identify. Perhaps whatever this material is prevents the decay of X'i?\n"
