      "Chs": "艾肯是我的团队关注的对象。人们对他们知之甚少，而这会使让对其的研究更加有趣！\n\n先澄清一点的是：我们大多数人对他们的了解比我们希望的要少......但比其他人要多。\n\n我们确实有一些没有被大多数历史学家广泛接受或考虑的猜测，如果我们完成后还有时间，我们也想去了解一下。\n\n-- 关于艾肯的生理学笔记 --\n他们的身体化学成分与我们迄今为止在全宇宙中看到的任何东西都不相似，影响他们细胞的东西非常少-专门的疾病似乎是影响他们的少数东西之一。他们以硅为基础，但却含有大量的DNA，与植物的基因构成相似。它们的身体甚至遵循一些与植物种相似的模式：它们放置一个球茎，球茎会生长到成熟期。如果条件合适，它将“孵化”，一个新的艾肯就有可能诞生。但不幸的是，这种情况的实际发生方式让我们摸不着头脑。人们认为这是一个无性的过程，但如果确实是这样，我们也无法证实受精是如何发生的。\n\n它们的出生率极低（到目前为止，据我们所知，在过去四十年中没有发生过一次活产），而且我们所能设计的任何方法都无法人为地诱导植物开花，形成新的艾肯。事实上，大多数时候，我们的方法只是破坏了植物内部的核心稳定。这是一件坏事，因为这些球茎有被剧烈运动就会爆炸的习性。当你对大多数形式的辐射没有免疫力时，这就异常危险了。我的团队以艰难的方式学到了这一点。但，我们在球茎实验室里也证实了一种额外的防卫措施。\n艾肯似乎能够根据需要生成这些球茎（可以说...这过程有点恶心，完全会让人联想到排便），并利用它们来实际运输他们的身体！我还看到他们用球茎的爆炸性来抵御威胁。而这还不是全部！这些球茎还构成了他们大多数艺术、住宅、武器和工具的基础！我真的想想象一下，用自己的碎片制作装备的感觉是啥样呢！\n\n他们的另一项天赋能力是形成放射性孢子堆，艾肯们可以用物理方式将其抛出。这显然完全是防御性行为，而且在古代很可能被用来使潜在的食物来源失去能力，同时保护自己。\n\n至于他们的外壳：似乎艾肯的“皮肤”在本质上与石墨非常相似。然而，它的分子不是六边形结构，而是具有非常不寻常的八边形结构，这使其与众不同。它似乎具有超强的吸收能力，使艾肯的大部分放射性反应不会从其体内溢出，而是被重新吸收，用于进一步为核心提供燃料。\n当艾肯活着的时候，这些血肉更加柔韧，一般都涂有一层薄薄的“羽毛”，作为其放射性核心的进一步绝缘。有了羽毛和肉体的结合，放射性能量的溢出几乎为零。\n然而，一旦艾肯死亡，他们的核心就立即开始不稳定。当这种情况发生时，他们的肉体就会变硬，变成石头一样的表面，如果不使用显微镜，就无法与石墨区分开。大约12小时后，它们的核心破裂并爆炸。结果是微小的核能爆炸，由于其石质肉体的吸收性，这场爆炸很快就会自我崩溃。一旦这个反应完成，他们的肉体就会进入完全惰性的状态。",
      "Eng": "X'i are the subject of my team's focus. Very little is known about them, which only makes them more interesting to study!\n\nTo be clear: most of us know less than we'd like about them...but more than anyone else does.\n\nWe do have some speculations not widely accepted or considered by most historians that we'd like to get into if time remains when we're done.\n\n-- Biological Notes on X'i --\nTheir body chemistry resembles nothing we've seen in our galaxy thus far, with very little affecting their cells - specialized diseases seem one of the few things that affect them. They are silicon based yet contain heavy doses of DNA that resembles the genetic makeup of plants. Their bodies even follow some similar patterns to the plant kingdom: they place a bulb, which grows to maturity. If the conditions are right it will 'hatch' and a new X'i could be born. The actual way this happens, unfortunately, eludes us. It is believed that this is an asexual process but we have no verification on how fertilization occurs if this is indeed the case.\n\nTheir birth rate is extremely low (thus far, to our knowledge, not a single live birth has happened in the last four decades) and no method we have been able to devise is capable of artificially inducing the plant to flower into a new X'i. In fact, most of the time this destabilized the core within the plant. This is a bad thing, as they have a habit of exploding when jostled firmly. When you're not immune to most forms of radiation, this is exceptionally hazardous. My team learned this the hard way. Extra precautions are now observed in the bulb lab.\nThe X'i seem to be able to generate these bulbs on demand (so to speak...it's actually a somewhat disgusting process that is entirely too reminiscent of defecating) and use them to physically transport their bodies! I've also seen them use the explosive aspect of the bulbs to ward off threats. And that's not all! These bulbs also form the basis for most of their art, homes, weapons and tools! Imagine crafting equipment from pieces of yourself!\n\nAnother of their innate capabilities is in forming wads of radioactive spore that a X'ian can physically lob. This is apparently entirely defensive in nature, and was likely utilized in ancient times to incapacitate potential food sources in addition to protecting themselves.\n\nAs for their shells: it seems that the 'skin' of a X'i is actually very similar in nature to Graphite. Rather than a hexagonal structure to its molecules, however, theirs has a very unusual octagonal structure that sets it apart. It appears to be exceptionally absorbent, allowing the majority of a X'is radioaction to not spill out from its body and instead be reabsorbed and used to further fuel the core.\nWhen the X'i is alive this flesh is more pliable and generally coated with a thin layer of 'feathers' that act as further insulation for their radioactive cores. With the feathers and flesh combined the spillage of radioactive energy is nearly zero.\nOnce a X'i dies, however, their core immediately begins to destabilize. When this occurs their flesh hardens into a stone-like surface that is indistinguishable from Graphite without use of a microscope. After approximately 12 hours their core ruptures and explodes. The result is a tiny explosion of nuclear energy that very quickly collapses in on itself due primarily to the absorbent nature of their stony flesh. Once this reaction is completed they become entirely inert."
