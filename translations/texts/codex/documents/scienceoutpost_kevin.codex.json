Later I also found out he was building an altar in my personal storage room decorated with photographs of my Uncle Steve. I have no idea how he got the pictures. Several piles of shaved wood sat in one corner, and a huge statue of my Uncle riding an angry Bullfrog made from split logs, decorated the other."
