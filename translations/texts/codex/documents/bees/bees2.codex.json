      "Chs": "^orange;与蜂共舞^reset;\n\n\n对于那些把养蜂作为爱好或职业的新手们，你萌好啊！ 这种有益的生活方式可不是一件轻松的事情。又要想取得甜蜜的胜利果实，又把一些蜜蜂扔进箱子就走开的话，那你可真是个懒狗！养蜂需要你记住很多事情。我会尽量在这里讨论主要问题，这样你就可以把精力放在重点上面了！\n\n\n\n^red;注意事项^reset;\n\n\n蜜蜂不会在你的飞船上生产或交配，但是在空间站可以。\n\n\n\n^orange;种族^reset;\n\n\n每种蜜蜂都有自己的优点和缺点，可以帮助或阻碍养蜂人，如果养蜂人是精明的，并且密切关注养蜂的福祉，那么最终养蜂回成为一项高利润的生意。不过，为了充分利用蜜蜂，你需要有耐心的进行实验。\n\n通过将蜂后与不同种类的工蜂交配来混合和匹配物种，可以大大提高蜂后后代的效能。有些蜜蜂喜欢特定的环境、时间和地点。还有一些蜜蜂会憎恨其他种类的蜜蜂，这意味着你可能需要注意养蜂场里养的是什么。请牢记这一点。\n\n^orange;蜜蜂的需求^reset;\n\n\n对于任何一个蜂巢来说，有几样东西是必需的，以便蜜蜂筑巢和生产商品。 首先也是最明显的一个就是他们居住的蜂房。自己动手做一个蜂房开始养蜂(我建议你能做多大的就做多大的！)。一旦你建好了蜂房，下一个(也是最重要的)步骤就是找蜜蜂。W在宇宙的荒野中漫步，留心观察。当你看到昆虫，就快拿出一个可靠的虫网，并开始捕捉。如果你足够幸运，你会发现属于自己的一只蜂后或工蜂！你需要一只蜂后和一只工蜂才能让蜂房运转起来！\n\n接下来，你需要花。蜜蜂是传粉者，这意味着它们在向前移动并将花粉传播到其他植物之前，会寻找并收集植物上的花粉。更多的植物(花是大多数蜜蜂的最爱)意味着更多的产量。对某些品种的蜜蜂来说，有些种类的花和植物对其更有吸引力。这意味着可能需要一些试验和错误，以筛选出绝对适合的蜜蜂类型。大多数蜜蜂都不是那种难以置信的挑剔，如果你不知道他们的最爱，那就用已有的植物或花将就着。\n\n制造好了蜂房之后，蜂后，工蜂和花之间还需要一个关键的齿轮来带动。框巢必不可缺，作为一个平台，蜜蜂在其上和周围生活并建立他们的蜂巢。我们，作为养蜂人，能够通过创造性地应用资源生产各种类型的框巢。良好的框巢可以深深地影响你的蜜蜂质量，尤其是当它们繁殖的时候，框巢可以提升他们的遗传能力！一定要仔细地寻找可用框架的潜在型号，并将它们与您的蜂巢需求和弱点相匹配，以最大限度地提高产量！\n\n最后，一天中的地点和时间会对蜂巢产生巨大的影响。一些蜜蜂厌恶某些环境(或者在其中会死个精光!)，而它们却在其他环境中茁壮成长。 作为养蜂人，你的职责就是了解哪些环境会让养蜂场欣欣向荣。有些蜜蜂只在白天活动(白天) ，有些只在夜间活动(夜间)。 一小部分蜜蜂可以在任何时候进行工作。\n\n最后要记住的是竞争: 一些蜜蜂会猎杀特定的亚种，并在激烈的竞争中杀死它们。如果附近另一个蜂巢里有它们的竞争对手，这些蜜蜂将永远无法繁衍生息。他们会自相残杀。\n\n\n\n^orange;显微镜^reset;\n\n\n在显微镜下检查可以识别任何蜜蜂的亚种，让你获得蜜蜂统计数据的知识，以帮助繁殖和选择过程。每级显微镜的性能都比前一级的稍好。最好的显微镜是电子显微镜。\n\n\n\n^orange;蜜蜂繁殖和生产^reset;\n\n\n把你的蜂后放在蜂房的第一个鸽子。那就是她要去的地方。工蜂放入了第二个格子。 请注意，在一个大型蜂房中，你有两个工蜂格子。这样你就可以放入两只“不同”的工蜂，为蜂后择偶过程增加遗传变异。左边的另一个格子放的是你的框巢(如果是大型蜂房就用两格)。填满这些格子之后，只要生活在那里的蜜蜂的需求得到满足，它们就会开始生产。 当这些需求得不到满足时，你的蜜蜂将无法交配。因此，如果您已经添加了所有应该需要的东西，但是什么都没有发生，那么就要检查一下可能发生的情况了。\n\n首先要检查的是其他蜜蜂类型是否会在完全相同的情况下生产。如果蜂蜜蜜蜂工作正常而兰草蜜蜂不工作，那么可能是时间不对，也有可能是生物群落，或者是附近的竞争对手阻止了“卡bug”的蜜蜂的繁殖。一旦需求得到满足，你的蜜蜂将开始生产资源！随着时间的推移，一切将缓缓前进，不管你是否在场。如果你在外部世界，养蜂场将“模拟”蜜蜂在你离开时所做的工作，并在你返回时应用。这是把双刃剑。因为机制也同样适用于蜂后寿命和螨虫(更多关于螨虫的信息在这一点后面) ，不注意的话这两者可以杀死一个蜂巢。蜂后的寿命是有限的，她们会在这段时间结束后死去。当蜂后死亡时，工蜂大约有60秒的安全时间，之后由于缺乏蜂后的引导，它们将开始慢慢死亡。这就会导致整个蜂巢的分崩离析。因此，育种的重要性变得清晰起来。\n\n\n\n繁殖蜜蜂需要: 蜂后、工蜂、蜂房和耐心。蜜蜂繁殖时你需要记住一些特性: 如果一只全新的蜂后和工蜂被放置在一个有框巢的空蜂房中，蜂后只会与第一只工蜂交配。这是一个人工选择的过程。 一旦她与工蜂交配完毕，她将开始制造自己的工蜂群，这些工蜂将成为她的种群。旧的工蜂将被杀死，因为它们现在已经是劣等货了。这些新的工蜂将完全模仿蜂后的基因组，不断生产。有时候，蜂后会生下一位幼年的蜂后。可以说，这些是你的金矿。用显微镜仔细观察这些小蜂后，然后把你最好的工蜂留下来繁殖后代。其余的，在蜜蜂避难所卖掉，轻松获利。\n\n每一代新的蜜蜂都有机会变异成优良的品种。突变的机会受到它们的种类、生物群落、框架和运气的影响。 当突变发生时，其收益是至少一项属性的随机加值。这项加值通常意义重大。通过人工选择，你可以引导你的蜜蜂进入一个高度优化的形式，能够传递给下一代。精心策划繁殖，利润颇丰。\n\n\n\n^orange;螨虫^reset;\n\n\n蜜蜂和养蜂人的克星是螨类的威胁。这些讨厌的小杂种侵入蜂巢，减缓生产并最终杀死工蜂。如果所有的工蜂都被螨虫感染而消灭，蜂后很快就会被杀死。螨虫会逐渐滋生，导致产量轻微下降，直到它们的数量失控。一旦失控，他们将很快开始掠夺你的工蜂。当这种情况发生时，你的蜂房会变成棕色红顶，显示一个昆虫图标，以让你知道这里发生了什么。螨虫可能是一种威胁，但谢天谢地，它们处理起来相当简单。抗螨框巢会让他们的短小无力(特别是更高级的版本) ，因为框巢可以堆叠，你可以直接提高队这些害虫的抗性。一旦螨虫被处理，你的蜂房将恢复到以前的外观，你的蜜蜂将恢复工作。\n",
      "Eng": "^orange;Working With Bees^reset;\n\n\nTo newcomers interested in beekeeping as a hobby or career, welcome! This rewarding lifestyle is not one walked lightly. Becoming successful in the trade requires more than just tossing some bees in a box and walking away! You have many things to keep in mind when beekeeping. I'll try to cover the major points here, so you can get to work on what really matters!\n\n\n\n^red;Note^reset;\n\n\nBees will not produce or mate on your ship. Space stations, however, will work fine.\n\n\n\n^orange;Species^reset;\n\n\nEvery species of bee has its own benefits and pitfalls that can help or hinder the beekeeper, with the end result being a highly profitable business if the keeper is savvy and keeps an eye on the well-being of his charges. To make the most out of bees, though, you'll need to be willing to experiment.\n\nMixing and matching species by mating a queen to a different sort of drone can substantially improve the potency of the offspring of that queen. Some bees prefer certain environments, times of day and locations. Others detest other families of bees, which means you might need to take care what you are breeding in your apiaries. Just keep that in mind.\n\n^orange;Bee Needs^reset;\n\n\nThere are several things that are necessary for any bee hive to nest and produce goods. The first and most obvious is an apiary for them to inhabit. Build yourself one of these to start with (I'd recommend a larger size one as soon as you are able!). Once you've set up the apiary, the next (and most important) step is to find some bees. Wander the wilds of the universe and keep an eye out. When you see insects, pull out a trusty bug net and start capturing them. If you get lucky, you'll find yourself a Queen or a Drone! You'll need both a Queen and a Drone to get an apiary running!\n\nNext, you'll need flowers. Bees are pollinators, which means they will seek out and gather pollen from plants before moving onward and spreading that pollen to other plants. More plants (flowers are a common favorite for most bees) means more production for your hives. Some types of flowers and plants are more appealing to certain breeds of bees than to others. This means some trial and error might be required to get the absolute most out of any bee type. Most are not incredibly picky, so any flower or plant will generally do if you don't know their favorites.\n\nOnce you've got the apiary, Queen, Drone and Flowers there is one more key piece of gear required. Frames are quite useful, acting as a platform for bees to live on and build their hive around and on. We, as beekeepers, are able to produce various types of frames through creative application of resources. Great frames can impact your bee quality quite heavily, especially when it comes time to breed them and enhance their genetic capability! Be sure to investigate the many potential types of frames available, and match them up with your hives needs and weaknesses to maximize production!\n\nFinally, the location and time of day can make a huge impact on a hive. Some bees loathe certain environments (or can be outright killed by them!) while they thrive in others. It's your duty as a keeper to learn which environments will result in your apiaries thriving. Some bees are active only during the day (Diurnal), some are active only at night (Nocturnal). A select few are able to operate at any time.\n\nThe final thing to keep in mind is rivals: Some bees will hunt particular subspecies down and kill them in a fierce rivalry. These bees will never thrive when nearby another hive containing their rivals. They'll just kill each other off.\n\n\n\n^orange;Microscopes^reset;\n\n\nChecking in a microscope can identify the subspecies of any bee, allowing you to gain knowledge of the bees stats to help in breeding and selection processes. Each tier of microscope performs slightly better than the previous tier. The greatest available type is the Electron Microscope.\n\n\n\n^orange;Bee Breeding and Production^reset;\n\n\nPlace your Queen in the first slot of the apiary. That's where she goes. The Drone goes in the second slot. Note that in a large apiary, you'll have two slots for drones. This allows you to put in two *different* drones, adding genetic variation towards the queens mate selection process. The other slot on the left side is for your frame (two, if using a large apiary). Once these slots are full, so long as the bees living there have their needs met, they will begin production. When those needs are not met, your bees will be incapable of mating. So, if you have added all that should be required and nothing is happening, it's time to check what might be up.\n\nThe first thing to check is if other bee types produce in the exact same situation. If honey bees work fine and orchid bees do not, then it could either be the time of day, or the biome, or nearby rivals that stop your 'broken' bees from thriving. Once the needs are met, your bees will start producing resources! This will happen gradually, over time, whether or not you are present. If you are off-world, the apiary will 'simulate' the work your bees would have done while away and apply it upon your return. This is both a benefit and a penalty, however, as it also applies the same data to queen age and Mites (more on this later), and both of those can kill a hive if not paying attention. Queens have a limited lifespan, and will die at the end of that time. When a queen dies, the drones have approximately 60 seconds of safety after which point they will begin to slowly die without her there to guide them. This leads to the inevitable collapse of the entire hive. Thus, the importance of breeding becomes clear.\n\n\n\nTo breed bees you will need: A queen, a drone, an apiary and patience. There are some peculiarities to keep in mind when breeding: If a brand new queen and drone are placed in an empty apiary with a frame, the queen will only mate with the FIRST drone added into the apiary. This is a selective breeding process. Once she has mated with the drone, she will then begin to produce her own stock of drones that will become her brood. The old drone(s) will be killed, being of now inferior stock. This new stock of drones will mimic the queens genome identically, producing constantly. Occasionally, a queen will birth a Young Queen. These are your goldmine, as it were. Scan the young queens in a microscope, and keep your best stock for breeding. The rest, sell at the Bee Refuge for easy profit.\n\nEach new generation of bees has a chance to mutate into a superior breed. The chance to mutate is influenced by their species, biome, frames and luck. When a mutation occurs, the benefit is a random bonus to at least one stat. This bonus is usually significant. Through selective breeding, you can guide your bees into a highly mutative form capable of passing on to new generations. With careful planning, that could lead to enormous profits.\n\n\n\n^orange;Mites^reset;\n\n\nThe bane of bee and beekeeper is the threat of Mites. These nasty little bastards infest hives, slowing production and eventually killing drones. Should all drones be eradicated by a Mite infection, the queen will be killed soon after. Mites infest gradually, causing slight slowdowns in production until such time as their population gets out of hand. At this point they will quickly begin preying on your drone stock. When this happens, your apiary will change color to a red-roofed, brown-sided version that displays an insect icon so there is no mistaking what has happened. Mites may be a threat, but they are thankfully quite simple to deal with. Anti-Mite frames will make short work of them (especially the higher tier versions), and since frames can be stacked you can improve the resistance to these pests directly. Once the mites are dealt with, your apiary will revert to its previous appearance and your bees will resume working.\n"
