      "Eng": "An alarming discovery was recently made while spying in a Floran collective. A row of Floran warriors were lined up, which was normal enough; what wasn't was the weaponry they bared.For one, it was the array of weaponry; several tech levels higher than would be assumed for them."

      "Eng": "Retreating to my scout ship wasn't going to be a quiet thing for sure, the sound of their weapon tests ringing out, rocking the air, and shaking my very being. Leaving their jungle huts safely out of my sight, it was only upon reaching the clearing where I had parked my shuttle that it now became clear that my choice of parking spot was a dire mistake. My personal shuttle, dented and firmly smashed up by runaway cannonballs, \nseveral of her systems damaged, the orbital engines nearly critically so. As I flee this planet of the damned, projectile warnings ring out from my Bitching Betty unit. But my shuttle is too damaged for anything but the laziest of evasions, I pray aloud that my ship won't be struck; the ablative plating already having been crumpled into a very expensive ball."
