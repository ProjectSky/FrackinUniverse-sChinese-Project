      "Eng": "After closer inspection, it seems that any and all stimulus experienced by C7 are also at least partially experienced by other subjects in the lab. When presented with a small amount of narcotic, C7 was rendered intoxicated. C6 through C24 all simultaneously shared the same precise physical actions for a period of 72 minutes."

      "Eng": "Every single rat has been 'changed' by C7. The upside is that all traces of the hostile virus have been removed from the host. Our prion works! Without some means to remove the negative effects, however, we will not be able to use it. I doubt everyone wants to lose who they were just to remove a sickness."

      "Eng": "Greg finally came out of his room after 2 full weeks. He is...different. He keeps repeating his name, over and over again. Nothing more. He becomes increasingly agitated trying to communicate with us. He clearly *thinks* he is talking fine. Yet all that comes out is 'Greg'. I've recommended he stay contained due to how the rats reacted to C7."

      "Eng": "I can't explain it, but somehow other subjects in the lab are now infected with whatever caused issues to C7. They exhibit the same symptomology, despite being in a clean-room with a dedicated air supply, glass walls and no direct contact to the subject. I checked the tapes from the night: no one entered or tampered with the experiments."

However, subject appears to have forgotten how to be a rat and is busy screeching at other rats in the room. Prion count is absurdly high. We won't merge him with the population this time as I have no desire to clean rat viscera off of every surface in the lab again."
