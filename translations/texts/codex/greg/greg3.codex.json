      "Eng": "Subject rat C7 appears to be fine, and even the blistering lesions are rapidly fading. Finally, a result we can work with! I do wonder how Greg solved the issue with the prion being so aggressive. He swears he didn't use the strange fluid we found on that moon orbiting Coronis IV. I am uncertain that I believe this, as Greg is not exactly the sort to accept delays on his results."

Or, rather, a potential one. We're going to try it on the rat-things today and begin observation. It should be noted that initial trials on genes in the lab were successful, though the method of transmission is unclear."
