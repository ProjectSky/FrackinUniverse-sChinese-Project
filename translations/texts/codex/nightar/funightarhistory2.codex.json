      "Eng": "Any further pressing for information about this Matriarch is met with nothing but silence. I dare not press deeper, as the menfolk have been eyeing me up for the last several days. One faux-pas and I could find myself tossed into a duel I cannot possibly win with one of their highly skilled swordsmen."

      "Chs": "现在的女族长是如何被选中的完全是未知的，因为女人们永远不会告诉像我这样的男人她们最私密的姐妹关系是如何运作的。他们只说她是道路，是向导，她的道路是真正的道路。通过她，他们是一体。只要向她宣誓效忠，陋居就是安全的。",
      "Eng": "How the current Matriarch is chosen is completely unknown, as the women would never tell a male such as myself how their most private sisterhood operates. They speak only that she is the Word, and the Guide, and that Her way is the true path. Through She, they are One. So long as ones fealty is sworn to Her the Burrow is safe. This seems to be sufficient explanation to them."

      "Eng": "More specifically, from She, the Great Matriarch, Avemnedara, Mistress of the Way...many names are given to She that Rules. The womenfolk are the only ones permitted to speak of her, or even refer to her. Males who do so must be cleansed through ritual combat followed by Conshak, a 'transfer of energy' from Beyond and into the warrior."

I have elected to mark down the information for preservation.

      "Eng": "We non-Nightar have often wondered why the Fulgrat, despite being publically referred to as their leader, has nothing whatsoever to do with territorial disputes, economics, trade or lawmaking...or any true requirements to keep a civilization going. The reason is simple:  The Fulgrat is their military General only. The true political pull among the Nightar comes from the females."
