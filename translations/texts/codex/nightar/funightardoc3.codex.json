I later learned that 'Byak' is the Nightar approximation for what we all affectionately refer to as Flesh Reapers, which immediately made it evident that such legends are credible. I wonder, then, what it was like to be a Nightar child in those times hearing tales of nightmare beasts stalking the shadows while being unable to escape into the glory of the sunshine we so take for granted among Humanity."

The Byak prowled the shadowy places between Baronies, a terror to all but the most skilled among them (and often used as a test for young warriors to prove their value).
