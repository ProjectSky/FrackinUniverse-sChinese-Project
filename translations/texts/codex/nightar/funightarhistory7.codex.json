This is a grave insult, meaning Red-Blood. On their world, due to low oxygen, their blood is blue. A Vilmaehkt is a 'filthy outsider', unworthy."

There are many reasons to this, the most visible being this: the more plain the mask, the more skilled the warrior. The highest ranked among their kind wear one that is plain white, with only narrow slits for eyes."
