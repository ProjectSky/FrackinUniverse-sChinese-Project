Conventional belief is that 'She' (whoever this might be is unknown) is responsible for their 'Gift of Shadow' and bestows upon their people the very ability to speak with the darkness of the void. This strange ability lets them directly affect themselves or others through control of the very essence of shadows. I also believe it is likewise the very reason they are cursed with severe allergy to light."
