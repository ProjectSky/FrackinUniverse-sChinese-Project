      "Eng": "As to why this is, none can be certain. It is theorized that the way their brains develop prohibit any capability of entertaining flights of fancy, preferring cold logic to all other means of reasoning. This lack of ability to accept fanciful notions has resulted in centuries of cultural adversity when dealing with the Avian people."

No documented records exist of deification of the sun, moon, or any other force in their ancient past and even their leadership was only ever treated with respect (and not, like most races, veneration and God-status)."
