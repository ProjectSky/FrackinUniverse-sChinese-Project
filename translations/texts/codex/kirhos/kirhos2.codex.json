      "Eng": "Many older arcology residents hold dreams of one day becoming a corporate executive, or even leaving to start their own.  Young Kirhos, however, hold no such ideas; counter-culture is thriving to a point where mass teenage rebellion is expected. However, most teenagers who ditch their home eventually return to another arcology, preferring the doldrums of civilization to the danger of exploration."
