      "Chs":"Kihos人在22岁才会被视为正式成年人。 政府允许各种公司在这时接触年轻的“啮齿动物”们，并提供工作机会。 通常来说，公司只会提供入门级职位，而最受追捧的职位是勘探、科学以及史密斯数据协议。 对于一个年轻的Kirhos来说，这三种职业最光荣，但是竞争也最激烈。",
      "Eng": "When they reach the age of 22, Kirhos are considered formal adults. At this point, Corporate entities are permitted by government to approach the young rodents with offers of employment. Typically these are entry-level positions, the most sought after being Exploration, Scientific or Data-Smith Contracts. These three career paths are considered to be the highest possible honor, and competition is fierce."
