      "Chs": "当他们达到22岁，鼠族人会被认为是正式的成年人。 在这一点上，政府允许法人实体向这些年轻的啮齿动物提供就业机会。通常这些都是入门级的职位，最受欢迎的是探索，科学或数据铁匠合同。 这三条职业道路被认为是最高的荣誉，而竞争是激烈的。",
      "Eng": "When they reach the age of 22, Kirhos are considered formal adults. At this point, Corporate entities are permitted by government to approach the young rodents with offers of employment. Typically these are entry-level positions, the most sought after being Exploration, Scientific or Data-Smith Contracts. These three career paths are considered to be the highest possible honor, and competition is fierce."
