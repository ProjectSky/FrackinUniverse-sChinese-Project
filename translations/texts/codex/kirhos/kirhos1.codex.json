      "Chs": "几百年前（或数千年...关于这一点的记录尚不明确），Kirhos人已经达到了科学和技术成就的绝对顶峰。 不幸的是，几乎在同一时间，他们就已经用尽了当前科技水平所需的所有资源。 随后发生的一系列残酷的战争，摧毁了他们的一切，他们只好逃向星空。",
      "Eng": "Some hundreds (or thousands...the records are unclear on this point) of years ago, the Kirhos had advanced to the absolute pinnacle of scientific and technological achievement.  Unfortunately, around the same time, they exhausted all resources on their homeworld required to utilize their knowledge. What followed was a series of brutal wars that devastated their infrastructure and led to them fleeing for the stars."

      "Chs": "他们已失去了他们的家园，这意味着他们很难再找到珍稀的铥元素的位置了。而铥元素是他们所有计算机技术的核心，没有铥元素，他们甚至无法维持从前的科技水平。他们可能需要一个世纪，甚至更久的时间来找到一个可用的替代品，并将它放置在Azakon Reticuli附近的小行星带深处。",
      "Eng": "The loss of their homeworld and its resources meant that the only known location of the super-rare element Thulium was forever lost. Thulium formed the core of all of their computer technology and without it they were unable to maintain their previous level of advancement. It was a century, perhaps longer, before a viable replacement was located deep in the asteroid belts near Azakon Reticuli."
