When the Glitch address each other, they do not use these prefix words. Perhaps something in their programming means they can read each others' tones without explanation."

I have noticed that when addressing me, the Glitch use prefix words. Examples: 'Dismissive', 'Annoyed', 'Sarcastic' and 'Frustrated'. Feeling as if this is a custom I should celebrate, I have begun to partake in such linguistic frippery myself."
