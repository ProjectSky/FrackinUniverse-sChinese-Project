      "Eng": "by K'arn Hollowbeak, Avian scholar\nThere are many forms of Avian burial, and the method often comes from the last will and testament of the deceased. Some Avians choose to float off attached to large balloons, while others favour cremation. Many simply opt for burial, but it is only the most important Avians who end up interred in tombs."
