      "Chs": "所有的机械人都注视着他们的国王向后倒下，他的机械人伪装脱落，露出一只黑白相间的鸟状生物。机械人们被骗了！一直以来，他们的暴君，不寻常的国王一直是一个伪装的太空海盗。这完全说得通。意识到游戏结束，受了重伤，邪恶的太空海盗逃走了，再也没有露面。",
      "Eng": "All the Glitch watched as their king fell backwards, his Glitch disguise falling away, revealing a small, black and white bird-like creature. The Glitch had been duped! All this time, their tyrannical, unusual king had been a space pirate in disguise. It made perfect sense. Realising the game was up, and badly injured, the evil space pirate made his escape, never to be seen again."

      "Chs": "当装甲机械人鞠躬之时，国王骇翼开始鼓掌欢呼。知道当士兵放下刀片，指责他在怀疑有什么不对劲的时候。刀片刺穿了他的金属外壳，外壳随着一声震耳欲聋的爆裂声震碎了。",
      "Eng": "King Dreadwing applauded and whooped as the armoured Glitch careened towards him. It was only as the soldier lowered its blade and charged that he suspected something was wrong. The blade pierced his metal shell, which shattered with a deafening crack."

      "Chs": "这个兵痞子原来只是位一时兴起的叶族人，她只是觉得无聊，于是决定去疯狂地打猎。她被授予机械人族荣誉英雄的称号，但随后又被立即放逐，因为杀死国王是不好的行为，即使国王是企鹅装的。从那天起，机械人发誓再也不允许另一个君主掌权，即使他们非常被恳切地请求。",
      "Eng": "The rogue soldier turned out to be the impromptu Floran, who had grown bored and decided to go on a hunting spree. She was made an honorary hero of the Glitch people, but then immediately exiled because killing kings is bad, even if they were penguins in disguise. From that day forth, the Glitch vowed never to allow another monarch to take control, even if they asked really nicely."
