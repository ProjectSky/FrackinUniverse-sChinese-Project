      "Chs": "他问起了飞升。 我向他解释了这一切，关于我成为太阳之子的历程。这为氦离子刺客笑了，并指责我的妄尊自大。 “当你能成为自己制造的神灵之时，你还有什么理由去冒着生命危险来得到神性呢？” 他问。 我开始思索，思索关于水晶塔，关于坠落，和那些没有飞起来的无数翼族人。",
      "Eng": "He asked about the Ascension. I explained it all to him, about my journey to become a Sunborn. The Helion laughed and accused me of hubris. 'Why risk your life to achieve godhood when you can become a god of your own making?' he asked. I thought about the Celestial Tower, about the fall, about the numerous Avians who did not fly."

      "Eng": "It is done. Larbeaks is no more. Nobody suspects a thing. And yet I am shaken, concerned. You see, the Helion visited me after the kill. This is unheard of. Almost never do the Helion reveal themselves to their clients. And yet, I woke up in the night to feel a hand on my shoulder."

      "Eng": "The Helion was not what I expected. He was soft-spoken, calm. His name is Hish'eth and he said I knew my mother. That he'd been there when she died. I asked him if that meant what I thought it meant. He shook his head, and I thought I could detect a sadness in his eyes."
