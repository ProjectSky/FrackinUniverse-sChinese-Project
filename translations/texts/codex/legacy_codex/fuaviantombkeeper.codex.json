      "Eng": "Tomb Guards also have to possess exceptional physical and mental skill. While it's never been documented in Avian history, it's entirely possible that a large armed group could descend upon a tomb, set on stripping it of its riches. As such, we spend many years reading up on how to deal with such a situation, until we feel we're ready for anything."

      "Eng": "by K'arn Hollowbeak, Avian scholar\nTomb Guards are regarded by other Avians as weird or creepy. The reason for this is because they willingly volunteer to live in a tomb for ten years. What others don't realise, though, is that being a Tomb Guard gives one plenty of time to reflect, to create, to plan. Some of my best works were prepared during my tenure as Tomb Guard."
