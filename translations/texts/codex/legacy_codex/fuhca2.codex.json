      "Eng": "I awoke to find myself surrounded by hooded figures, chanting and squawking. One of them, who appeared to be the figurehead, held a large knife above me. At first I was disoriented, and thought I was back with the Florans. But no. It seems I'd accidentally presented myself for sacrifice. So silly!"

      "Chs": "当然，我不想这样！我飞快地一脚射在祭司长的脸上，逃了出去，像鲛人附身一样冲进了庙宇。一路上当然有一些伤亡——一些神圣的瓮，一两尊雕像，一位翼族修道士——但我完好无损地逃了出来，继续我的旅程。",
      "Eng": "Of course, I wasn't up for this! Quick as a flash, I kicked the head priest in the face and made my escape, charging through the temple like a Hylotl possessed. There were a few casualties along the way, of course - some sacred urns, a statue or two, an Avian monk - but I escaped intact, and carried on my way."
