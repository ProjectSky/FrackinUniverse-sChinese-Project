      "Eng": "I boarded another airship village today, when it had stopped to dock. Climbed my way up the anchor and squirreled myself into a cabin before anyone could complain. Everything was going well; the captain, a jolly fellow called Wrenolds, allowed me to teach him how to play Lilyflip. We were half way through a game when it happened. I was winning."

      "Eng": "I was unaware the Avians had developed armour that allowed them to fly again. I commented on this to Wrenolds, and he told me it was unheard of. He muttered something about power crystals, and then I heard him mention my dear friend Greenfinger, who they were apparently going to see. What luck! I informed him he could drop me off there."

      "Eng": "The bullets simply bounced off the iron Avian, who laughed, smashed the ship's mast, then leaped into the air. A glowing circle on his chest began to pulsate, then thrusters in the man's feet kicked in, and the Avian took off, soaring into the skies like a rocket ship. What a sight!"

      "Eng": "The door to the cargo hold splintered open, and a large, metallic Avian came striding out. Swiftly he dispatched a number of the ship's crew, punching and smashing his way around. I cowered in fear, hiding behind the captain, who let off some shots from his rifle."
