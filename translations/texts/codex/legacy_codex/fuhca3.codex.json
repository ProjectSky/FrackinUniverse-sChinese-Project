      "Chs": "我爬上庙宇，渐渐感到疲惫，在连续几天的冒险和逃亡之后，我疲惫的双腿几乎要断掉了。在山顶，我发现了一张石床。牧师们在附近转来转去，但是当我躺下的时候，他们似乎并不介意。事实上，他们开始欢呼雀跃。其中一个人递给我一杯美味甜美的饮料。很快，我就睡着了。",
      "Eng": "I ascended the temple and grew tired, my weary legs almost giving out after days of adventuring and fleeing. At the top, I found a stone bed. Priests milled about, but they did not seem to mind when I lay down. In fact, they began to cheep and cheer. One of them handed me a delicious, sweet-tasting drink. Soon, I drifted off to sleep."

      "Chs": "我迷失了方向，需要指引(航海的那种，不是精神的那种) ，我走进了一座令人印象深刻的翼族庙宇。我立刻感到平静，仿佛一种平和降临到我的身上。我走在石头走廊里，凝视着那只巨鸟的雕像，偶尔也会向牧师和崇拜者打招呼。他们似乎很高兴见到我。",
      "Eng": "Lost and in need of guidance (the navigational kind, not the spiritual kind), I made my way into an impressive Avian temple. Immediately I felt at peace, like a calm had descended over me. I walked the stone hallways, gazing up at the statues of that giant bird, occasionally greeting priests and worshippers alike. They seemed pleased to see me."
