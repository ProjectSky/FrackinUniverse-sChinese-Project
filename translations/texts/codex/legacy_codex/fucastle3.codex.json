      "Eng": "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer\nThe Glitch may not be the warmest of people on the outside, but their hospitality is undisputable. They found me scaling the castle wall, simply wanting to have a look through a tower window, and politely invited me inside. Now, of course it sounded like a trap, so there was a bit of a scuffle at first, but it turned out they were genuine."
