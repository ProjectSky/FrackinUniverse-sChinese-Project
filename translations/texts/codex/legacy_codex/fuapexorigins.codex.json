Any Apex who steps out of line, says the wrong thing, eats the wrong banana or looks at one of the many hidden cameras in a funny way will be subjected to Miniknog Therapy, designed to improve the species. In fact, all Apex should volunteer for this. Sign up now."

Of course, Apex history only reaches back about one hundred years, due to a series of accidental fires, explosions and rogue mech accidents which destroyed all of the archives ever."
