      "Eng": "For centuries, the Avians soared through the skies, borne on wings of feather and flesh. They were a proud, peaceful species, respectful of their traditions and gods. So respectful, in fact, that when their gods - the Sunborn - spoke to them, they listened. They listened and obeyed as one god, Kluex, the last of the Sunborn, commanded their elders to clip the wings of the lower-caste Avians."

They obeyed as their elders erected tall towers, from which the Ascendants - the chosen Flightless - were to leap. They obeyed as one by one, the Ascendants hit the ground, never to fly again. Kluex, they were told, was pleased. "
