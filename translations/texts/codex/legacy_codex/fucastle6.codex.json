      "Eng": "One day, a group of Glitch scientists hit upon an idea. They had no idea how to create more of their number, of course, but they were rather adept at making stylish suits of armour. It had often been remarked upon how the armour looked like the Glitch themselves, and so they set to work commissioning a number of blacksmiths to make as many suits of armour as possible."
