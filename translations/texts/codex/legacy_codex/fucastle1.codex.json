      "Eng": "It is the Outcasts who interest me most. Many of these free-thinking Glitch have come into our midst. Their physiology means they have little to fear from the Florans, but there is more than that. There is an affinity between the two species, of which there is no denying."

      "Chs": "由叶族人的绿手指所著\n自从我们两个物种走到一起，“机械人”就一直是我心中的一个谜团。“有意识的机械人”在许多方面让我想起了我们的族人; 异乎寻常的被动，专注于团队合作。然而，通过选择，叶族成为了一个整体，但机械人们似乎与某种中央主机相连。也许是一个有意识的人工智能？或者别的什么。历史已经遗忘了真相。尽管如此，值得注意的是，以这种方式来考虑，叶族人人在社会进步方面远远超过了机械人。",
      "Eng": "by Greenfinger of the Florans\nEver since our two species came together, the Glitch have been a source of intrigue for me. The Hivemind Glitch remind me of our people in many ways; singularly driven, focus on teamwork. And yet the Florans work as a unit through choice, but the Glitch appear connected to some kind of central mainframe. A sentient AI, perhaps? Or something else. The truth has been lost to history. Nonetheless, it is remarkable to consider that in this way, the Florans far outmatch the Glitch in terms of societal advancement."
