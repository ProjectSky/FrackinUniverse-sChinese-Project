      "Eng": "I came to what could only be described as a slum. Male Eld'uukhar dressed in rags were huddled by clusters of Thanatite crystal to keep warm, horribly thin from a lack of food. Haunted, I left that place quickly, and the planet soon after. I doubt I'll be making another trip."

      "Eng": "I took a trip recently to the Eld'uukhar inhabited planet in the system Magna Ilo to trade for a few crystals. The cities of this planet were just as opulent as I had heard, buildings crafted from crystal and gold, towering spires that touched the sky. Their temples were a sight to behold. I did not venture inside out of respect for the worshippers"

      "Eng": "but I'd imagine the inside to be just as beautiful. Despite the wonders I have seen there, I have left that planet with a feeling of unease. I had taken a wrong turn and found myself in a sector that seemed to be abandoned. The temples that I had seen were here also, but as piles of dirty rubble, and banners embroidered with a symbol I had not seen before were laid torn and ruined on the ground."
