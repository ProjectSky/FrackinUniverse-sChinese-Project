      "Chs": "厄休安龙人间有两个管理机构，圣殿议会和人民议会。人民议会读圣殿议会负责。人民议会是选举产生的，而圣殿议会则是根据四名牧师(两男两女)的意愿决定的，这四名牧师食用超脱水晶以促进神灵与他们自己之间的沟通，并通过这种方式决定谁将被任命(顺便说一句，除了这四名牧师之外，其他所有人都禁止食用超脱水晶，他们最终死亡时，他们的子女将取代他们)。",
      "Eng": "The Eld'uukhar have two governing bodies, the temple council, and the people's council. The people's council answers to the temple council. The people's council is elected, whereas the temple council is decided based on the will of four priests, two male, two female, who consume Exonite crystals to elicit communication between the deities and themselves, and through this decide who will be appointed (As an aside, the consumption of Exonite is forbidden to all but these four, who are replaced by their children when they eventually die)."
