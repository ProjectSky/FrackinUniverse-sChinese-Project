      "Eng": "Despite the Uplifting going well (beyond our expectations, in fact), there has been an unintended side-effect. The Fenerox are -insanely- loyal to us. We failed to take into account their particularly unique pair-bonding mechanism their kind practices. It seems that once they imprint, they are unwilling to separate from the target of their bond. Ever."

      "Chs": "所以，我们现在几乎在任何地方都有永久的伙伴陪伴着我们。不过也有好的一面，谢天谢地——如果它们的配对关系受到威胁，耳廓狐是凶悍的猎手。这可能是长久以来不变的交配习惯所遗留下来的。因此，在过去的三个恒星周期里，我们从未在一笔交易上被欺骗过。我们的利润增加了，因为没有人愿意冒险让我们的新“看门狗”发怒",
      "Eng": "So, we have permanent attaches that accompany us just about everywhere now. There is a positive to this, thankfully - Fenerox are highly capable hunters and intensely ferocious if their pair-bonds are threatened. This is likely a holdover from eons of unchanged mating habits. As such, we have not been cheated on a deal in over 3 solar cycles. Our profits are up, because nobody wants to risk the wrath of our new 'guard dogs'"
