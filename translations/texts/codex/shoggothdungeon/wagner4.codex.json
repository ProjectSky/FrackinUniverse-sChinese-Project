      "Eng": "I'm not exactly sure what the hell is going on here. We found some sort of...door in the cavern near Vostok. Considering the carbon-dating and the undocumented language I imagine that Princeton is going to have an absolute field day sharing our discovery with the world. That is, of course, provided we ever manage to get back to camp. Something strange happened that neither Richter nor myself can even begin to adequately explain."

Damaging this find was out of the question. Nothing seemed to work. That's when things got weird. The wall seemed to open of its own accord, and a force that can only be described as"

The air here is thick and almost unbreathable and there is some sort of foul taste permeating everything that reminds me of a funeral or something else morbid like that.

I don't know what happened to Richter, but he wasn't with me when I came to. Around me now is some sort of temple matching the door we found, and I can hear something. I don't know what it is, but it is close. I have only enough power to last another few hours and then my reserve batteries will be wiped"
