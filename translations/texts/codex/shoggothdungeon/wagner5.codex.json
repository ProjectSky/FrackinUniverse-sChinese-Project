And then I see it, rising from a black bit like some sort of sentient vomit plastered with a thousand visages undulating beneath the skin. Rather than run in fear, I stab at it with the device. There is a flash, and then I am awake."

I could sense it, perhaps because of my dreams...and I knew in that moment that it intended nothing good for us. As I turned to call for the others there was a shift of limb and barrel-like body...and it was gone."
