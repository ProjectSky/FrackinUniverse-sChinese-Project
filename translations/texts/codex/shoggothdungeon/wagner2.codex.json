I think it may be in his eyes. It's almost as if he sees you and...knows you in ways he shouldn't. He even made comments on events in my life he wasn't present for."

There were noticable changes in his behavior, especially in regards to social communication. When asked to stop behaving strangely, he savagely lunged at Doakes and attempted to bite him. We had to restrain him to inject him with a sedative."
