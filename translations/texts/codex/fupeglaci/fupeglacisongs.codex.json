      "Eng": "Among the races in the galactic core, few are as capable of beautiful song as the Peglaci. Their people have honed their vocal cords over millenia into some of the most advanced sound-making organs known to science. They are capable of reaching a stunning 15 to 40 octave range, depending on their familial heritage!"

      "Eng": "Another fine example would be the Hevlar Corps, an elite branch of the Protectorate Defense Force composed entire of Peglaci. Through special sound-based training they are capable of eliminating threats without even needing to shoot. Soothing targets to sleep, and then imprisoning them, is much cleaner than wet works."

Their 'songs' are even capable of calming others if they can find the right frequency. This has led to some unique talents among professionals of their species."
