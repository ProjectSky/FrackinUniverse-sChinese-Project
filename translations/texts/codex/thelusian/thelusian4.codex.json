      "Chs": "很少有物种像这些昆虫一样排外，这在它们与大地守护团的交流中表现出来。如果可以避免的话，他们宁愿不与其他种族交流，但他们也愿意充当保镖和战士，因为这是他们擅长的方面。也许有一天，女王会选择与其他种族会面，改变蚁族人民的看法，但迄今为止，没有一位女王与其他种族会过面。",
      "Eng": "Few species are as xenophobic as these insectoids, and it shows in their interactions with the Protectorate. They prefer to not speak with other races at all if avoidable, but are happy to act as bodyguards and warriors where they typically excel. There may come a day when a Queen chooses to meet with the other races and change the perception of their people, but to date no Queen has ever been seen by the eyes of an outsider."
