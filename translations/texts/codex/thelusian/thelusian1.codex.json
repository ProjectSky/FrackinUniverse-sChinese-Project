      "Chs": "人们对蚁族人的社会结构认知之甚少，因为他们只允许自己巢穴的人进入巢穴。毫不夸张地说，任何其他进入的东西都会立即被杀死和吞噬，而不会被给予任何解释的机会。这种强烈的保护本能使这种动物存活了数十亿年，并为它们的人口增长做出了巨大贡献。",
      "Eng": "Very little is known of the social structure of the Thelusians, as they permit no living being not of their own Hive Brood into the hive. Quite literally anything else entering will be immediately killed and devoured without any attempt at diplomacy. This strong protection instinct has kept their kind alive for billions of years, and contributed heavily to their reputation."
