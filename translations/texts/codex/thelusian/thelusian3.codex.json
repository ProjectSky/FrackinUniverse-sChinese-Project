      "Eng": "While carnivorous, the Thelusians are not territorial or aggressive save when protecting the Hive. This is a good thing, because now that they have learned they can Spore (the term used for their spreading of eggs) into space to spread through the cosmos their population will be booming quite soon. This has been referred to in Protectorate casebook C45631-N, sub-clause B as a Type C potential threat."
