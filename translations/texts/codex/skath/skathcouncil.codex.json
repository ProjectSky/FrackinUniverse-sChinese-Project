      "Chs": "绘世者一族的政体被称为“古老者议会”，就像它的名字一样，四位他们种族的古老者统治着整个族群。这是宇宙中已知的唯一一种这样形式的政府（为什么四个人就可以决定整个族群的命运？），但他却维持了绘世者帝国至少两百到三百年的秩序。",
      "Eng": "The body politic of the Skath is referred to as 'The Council of Elders' and is exactly what it sounds like. The four eldest of their kind rule the entire species. It is the only such form of government known in the cosmos (for how can only four dictate the course of an entire species?) but has maintained power over the Skath Imperium for at least two to three hundred years."

      "Chs": "据说第一届议会是由人民投票选出的，但关于那个时代的所有文件早已失传。就我个人而言，我很难相信整个族群都会同意凌驾于一切之上的权利应该被赋予古老者。这其中的逻辑令人害怕，至少可以说，现实比我们想象的更糟。",
      "Eng": "The first council is said to have been voted upon by the people, but all documentation of that era has been long since lost. Personally, I find it hard to believe that an entire species agreed that absolute power over all should rest on the shoulders of their Elders. The logistics of that are frightening, to say the least. The reality is worse."

      "Eng": "To be considered for the council, a Skath must first reach the age of Last Nest (somewhere around sixty in human years) and have no less than three hundred offspring. His role in the military must have been a major one, with a rank no less than Admiral. Finally, they must have seen combat at least twice (heroics and long-standing combat records are preferred.)"
