      "Chs": "尽管当他们面对不是和他们同一种族的族群时往往显得性情残忍，但结果是无从辩驳的。不论是等离子武器，还是强大又近乎无穷的能源，又或是独特的推进方式都来自绘世者一族的研究。",
      "Eng": "Despite their often cruel disposition when it comes to species not of their lineage, the results cannot be argued against. Plasmic weapons, enhanced and nearly limitless energy sources and unique forms of propulsion are all discoveries owed to the Skathian research methodology."

      "Eng": "Some among the Skath believe the Seekers have one more sacred duty: To seek out and locate the race that attempted to wipe them out not so long ago and bring the vengeance of the Skath against them. These 'Volarians' apparently responsible are unknown to us. The common belief here is that they are another species already known, but whom remain a mystery to the Skath."

      "Eng": "The primary mission of the Seeker caste is the betterment of Skathian life, even at the expense of other lives. Experimentation on other bipedal species is rarely off-the-table (in fact, most research *starts* here for the Skath) and is one of the primary reasons they were not permitted to join the Protectorate. They have instead joined the League of Non-Aligned Worlds."
