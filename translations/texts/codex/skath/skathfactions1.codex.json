The very nature of their council is corrupt at its root, and the average Skath is ignorant of the extent of this issue. The result is a social heirarchy reliant on unjust and idiotic leaders quite accepting of bribes and general favoritism based on profits."

The Vanguard believes that with enough warships and enough defensive measurements, other races will not dare to attack, thus resulting in peace. Unfortunately, this is but a concept...and not how things actually work in practice."

Of course, these rules are subject to change at a moments notice due to the interference of the Council, and even the most intelligent Admiral is at their mercy when it comes to rule of law."
