      "Chs": "侵略战争往往是以“自保”的名义发起，只要无能的领导人在台上多一天，就会有更多战争到来。大多数绘世者不了解拥有一个腐败议会的严重性，这将导致整个社会阶层都受那些愚蠢的不公正的贪官污吏控制。",
      "Eng": "More than one invasion has been carried out under the pretense of 'protecting' their kind, and many more will follow so long as inept leadership is allowed to rule their people. The very nature of their council is corrupt at its root, and the average Skath is ignorant of the extent of this issue. The result is a social heirarchy reliant on unjust and idiotic leaders quite accepting of bribes and general favoritism based on profits."

      "Eng": "Some have even whispered that the Kirhosi may be partly responsible for this corruption through the promotion of trade markets in Skathian territories, but this is hearsay I cannot verify. By casual observation, I would tend to agree...to a point. Kirhosi are hardly secretive about their love of Trade for profit."

      "Eng": "The Vanguard are the military arm and command the fleets and fortress worlds of the Skath. It is without doubt the biggest faction of their kind, due in part to their desire to protect their spawn-worlds. The Vanguard believes that with enough warships and enough defensive measurements, other races will not dare to attack, thus resulting in peace. Unfortunately, this is but a concept...and not how things actually work in practice."

      "Eng": "The Vanguards duty is to protect Skath worlds by any means necessary. Commanders and Admirals of their fleets have follow the Codex of War to the letter. Of course, these rules are subject to change at a moments notice due to the interference of the Council, and even the most intelligent Admiral is at their mercy when it comes to rule of law."
