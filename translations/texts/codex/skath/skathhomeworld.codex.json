Its vast oceans cover about 78% of the planets surface. Most cities and our capital Thela is located on the ocean floor, where our origin is."

Experimental antimatter cannons are stationed in orbit as well as on the surface, that rips any cruiser in half in a matter of seconds.

      "Eng": "Unusually, Norkumgsgath does not possess any seasons at all due to a unique rotation and orbit that ensures both sides of the world are always equally exposed to numerous factors. Its moon, Thetala, functions primarily as a spaceport and military factory with a tidal-locked surface so reflective that it acts like a second sun."
