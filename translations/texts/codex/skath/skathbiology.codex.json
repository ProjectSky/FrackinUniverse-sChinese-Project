      "Eng": "As for spawning young: the Skath have at least kept this part of their species unchanged despite the swap to newer climates. Females lay between six and twenty eggs, fertilized by the males during spawning season, which both partners aid in protecting until they hatch. At this point, both are responsible for the teaching of young."

      "Eng": "For some reason, despite their aquatic nature the Skath are fully amphibious and have begun living on the surface as well. Many theorize that this is an attempt by their Council to force-start an evolution in their species in order to maximize their persistence among the stars."

This makes the Skath the fastest populating race in the known galaxy next to the Thelusians (which is of great concern to the Protectorate due to the Affordance Treaties of 2331)."

Without a proper mixture of humidity in the air a Skath will suffer exposure rapidly, leading to their eventual death within a few minutes in some cases. To combat this, Skath have created environmental still-suits to recycle their moisture and keep themselves comfortable."
