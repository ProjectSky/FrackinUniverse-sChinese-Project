      "Eng": "But after we felt safe, our scanners detected a tiny fleet traveling across one of our colonized systems. They weren't one of us and besides...some people were curious about who these interlopers were. A large portion of Skathkind was afraid that these might be Valorian remnants. Thus a huge mistake was made: The mysterious fleet was shot down by Admiral Yethix."
