      "Eng": "The First Contact war made the Skath into one of the most paranoid races in the known galaxy. While they will deny that it is fear, and instead chalk it up to 'nerves', there is no doubt to the classic fight-or-flight response a Skath enters when startled. So imagine just how paranoid they could get with *planning* behind it."

      "Eng": "This paranoia led directly to the creation of Fortress Worlds. These are elected at random by the Council and declared holy sites. They are then cleansed of all non-Skath lifeforms and their surface virtually covered in weaponry of any available sort. Billions of cannons, missile silos, gravity launchers and the largest military staging platforms in the known universe."
