      "Eng": "Having spread too rapidly and too far among the neighboring systems stressed their economy until it reached an inevitable breaking point. The Mantizi, never great with money in the first place (they are far too hard-coded to use current resources for short-term gain, due in part to their natural evolution as a species), were not even aware of a problem until it was too late."

No, it was something else entirely that contributed to the downfall of their once great civilization. Expansionism brought them to the death-knell, as it were."

Workers could no longer be paid, and the unemployment rate rapidly reached over 87% (estimated 87.72% at the official time of dissolution). What followed was a massive civil war, and the complete slaughter of every single member of the senate. Even the Oracles were slain, their entrails used as sashes."
