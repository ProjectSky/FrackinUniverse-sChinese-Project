There are countless entries about this unnamed species they created , but none that give anything useful until roughly 824 years after the first entry.> It was assumed they would retain their docile traits, as we specifically erased the capacity for anger and rage in the initial generations."

With our physical bodies beginning to erode...time is precious."
